The purpose of this project was to create a vehicle speed estimation system.
This system that was used to detect vehicles was YoloV3.

The code requires 3 files in order to function.
2 excel files for the storage of car location and car velocity between each frame.
1 video file for the program to process.

The presentation provides a deeper anaylysis of how the code operates and the overall conclusion of the project.
