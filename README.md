The purpose of this project was to create a vehicle speed estimation system.
This system that was used to detect vehicles was YoloV3.

The code requires 3 files in order to function.
2 excel files for the storage of car location and car velocity between each frame.
1 video file for the program to process.




The results provide a rough estimation of the vehicle speed since homography was not utilized to obtain the "real-life" measurements.
